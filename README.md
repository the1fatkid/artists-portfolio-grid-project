# Patrick Star's Portfolio 🪸˖°𓇼🌊⋆🐚🫧

Welcome to **Patrick Star's Portfolio** website! This project showcases the imaginary portfolio of a talented artist and serves as a demonstration of extensive use of CSS Grids, animations, and JavaScript for functionality and responsiveness.

## 🤖 Features

- **Grid-Based Layout**:  
  The website's layout is structured using CSS Grids to beautifully showcase the artist's artwork in an organized and visually appealing manner.

- **Responsive Design**:  
  Fully responsive design ensures the portfolio looks stunning across all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

- **Animated Navbar with Hamburger Menu**:  
  - On smaller screens, the navigation bar collapses into a **hamburger icon**.  
  - Clicking the hamburger icon triggers a **CSS animation** that transforms the three lines into an `X`.  
  - A vertical side navbar smoothly appears on the right side of the screen.  
  - Clicking the `X` animates the side navbar back into the hamburger icon.

- **CSS Animations**:  
  All the navabar transitions and interactions are enhanced with smooth and engaging CSS animations.

- **JavaScript Functionality**:  
  JavaScript is used to make the navbar interactive and toggle the animations between the hamburger menu and side navbar.
